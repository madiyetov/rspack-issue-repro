## Rspack's issues 

### 1. Get the working app

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `cd apps/remote`
3. Run `npm start`

These 3 steps will start the server. And the app will work correctly.

### Issue with CompressionPlugin

And the uncommenting [this plugin](./apps/remote/rsbuild.config.ts#L55) will crash the `npm start`.
